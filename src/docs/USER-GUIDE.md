## Core Concepts

Understanding these foundational concepts will help you effectively use Ontos.

### Domains

**Domains** represent logical groupings of data based on business areas or organizational structure. They provide high-level organization for your data assets.

- **Hierarchical**: Domains can have parent-child relationships (e.g., "Retail" → "Retail Operations")
- **Examples**: Finance, Sales, Marketing, Customer, Product, Supply Chain
- **Purpose**: Group related data products and provide clear ownership boundaries

### Teams

**Teams** are collections of users and groups working together on data initiatives.

- **Members**: Can include individual users or Databricks workspace groups
- **Domain Assignment**: Teams can be associated with specific domains
- **Role Overrides**: Individual members can have custom roles within the team
- **Metadata**: Track team information like Slack channels, leads, and tools

### Projects

**Projects** are workspace containers that organize team initiatives with defined boundaries.

- **Types**: 
  - **Personal**: Individual user workspaces (auto-created)
  - **Team**: Shared workspaces for collaborative work
- **Team Assignment**: Multiple teams can collaborate on a project
- **Isolation**: Provides logical boundaries for development work

### Data Contracts

**Data Contracts** define the technical specifications and guarantees for data assets following ODCS v3.0.2 standard.

- **Schema Definition**: Column names, types, constraints, and descriptions
- **Quality Guarantees**: Data quality rules and SLOs (Service Level Objectives)
- **Semantic Linking**: Connect schemas and properties to business concepts
- **Lifecycle**: Draft → Proposed → Under Review → Approved → Active → Certified → Deprecated → Retired
- **Versioning**: Track contract evolution over time

### Data Products

**Data Products** are curated collections of Databricks assets (tables, views, models) delivered as consumable products.

- **Product Types**: Source, Source-Aligned, Aggregate, Consumer-Aligned
- **Input/Output Ports**: Define data flows and dependencies
- **Tags**: Organize and discover products using standardized tags
- **Status**: Development → Sandbox → Pending Certification → Certified → Active → Deprecated

### Semantic Models

**Semantic Models** provide a knowledge graph connecting technical data assets to business concepts.

- **Business Concepts**: High-level domain concepts (Customer, Product, Transaction)
- **Business Properties**: Specific data elements (email, firstName, customerId)
- **Semantic Linking**: Three-tier system linking contracts, schemas, and properties to business terms
- **RDF/RDFS**: Based on standard ontology formats for interoperability

### Compliance Policies

**Compliance Policies** are rules that automatically check your data assets for governance requirements.

- **DSL (Domain-Specific Language)**: Write rules in a SQL-like declarative syntax
- **Entity Types**: Check catalogs, schemas, tables, views, functions, and app entities
- **Actions**: Tag non-compliant assets, send notifications, or fail validations
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Run policies on schedules to track compliance over time

   - **Description**: What the schema represents
   - **Type**: Table, View, Model, etc.

3. Add **Authoritative Definitions** (optional but recommended):
   - Click **Add Semantic Link**
   - Search for a business concept (e.g., "Customer")
   - Select the concept to link

#### Adding Properties (Columns)

For each schema object:

1. Click **Add Property**
2. Fill in details:
   - **Name**: Column name (e.g., "customer_id")
   - **Logical Type**: String, Integer, Date, etc.
   - **Required**: Is this field mandatory?
   - **Unique**: Must values be unique?

Link the entire contract to a business domain concept.

**Example**: "Customer Data Contract" → "CustomerDomain" business concept

**When to Use**: High-level domain classification

#### 2. Schema-Level Links

Link schema objects (tables, views) to specific business entities.

**Example**: "customers" table → "Customer" business concept

**When to Use**: The schema represents a specific business entity

#### 3. Property-Level Links

Link individual columns to business properties.

**Example**: "email" column → "email" business property

**When to Use**: Every important data element (recommended for all columns)

**Benefits**:
- Enables semantic search ("find all tables with customer email")
- Provides business glossary integration
- Supports data lineage and impact analysis
- Facilitates cross-domain data discovery

## Semantic Models

Semantic Models provide a knowledge graph that connects technical data assets to business concepts.

### What are Semantic Models?

Semantic Models define:
- **Business Concepts**: High-level domain entities (Customer, Product, Order)
- **Business Properties**: Specific data elements (email, firstName, productId)
- **Relationships**: How concepts relate to each other
- **Hierarchies**: Taxonomies and categorizations

### Viewing Semantic Models

Navigate to **Semantic Models** in the sidebar.

**What You'll See**:
- List of business concepts
- List of business properties
- Concept details (definition, examples, relationships)
- Property details (data type, format, constraints)

### Using Semantic Models

#### Linking Contracts to Concepts

When creating a data contract:

1. At **Contract Level**: Link to high-level domain concept
   - Example: "Customer Data Contract" → "CustomerDomain"

2. At **Schema Level**: Link table to specific entity
   - Example: "customers" table → "Customer" concept

3. At **Property Level**: Link column to business property
   - Example: "email" column → "email" property

#### Benefits of Semantic Linking

1. **Discovery**: Find all tables containing "customer email"
2. **Consistency**: Ensure "email" field has same format everywhere
3. **Documentation**: Auto-generate business glossary
4. **Lineage**: Track business concepts through transformations
5. **Compliance**: Check policies based on semantic meaning

### Semantic Search

Use the search bar to find assets by business concept:

**Examples**:
- Search "customer" → Find all assets linked to Customer concept
- Search "email" → Find all columns representing email addresses
- Search "PII" → Find all assets containing personal information

### Exploring Concept Relationships

Click on a concept to see:
- **Definition**: What this concept means
- **Properties**: Which business properties belong to this concept
- **Related Concepts**: Parent/child and associated concepts
- **Linked Assets**: Which contracts, schemas, and tables use this concept

### Custom Semantic Models

To add custom business concepts and properties:

1. Create RDF/RDFS files defining your concepts
2. Place files in `/src/backend/src/data/taxonomies/`
3. Restart the application
4. Concepts will be available in the semantic linking dialogs

**RDF Format Example**:

```turtle
@prefix ontos: <http://example.com/ontology#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

ontos:Subscription a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Subscription" ;
    rdfs:comment "Customer subscription to a service or product" ;
    rdfs:subClassOf ontos:BusinessConcept .

ontos:subscriptionId a rdf:Property ;
    rdfs:label "Subscription ID" ;
    rdfs:comment "Unique identifier for a subscription" ;
    rdfs:domain ontos:Subscription ;
    rdfs:range xsd:string .
```

## Compliance Checks

Compliance Policies automate governance by checking data assets against defined rules.

### Compliance DSL

The Compliance Domain-Specific Language (DSL) enables you to write declarative rules similar to SQL.

#### DSL Structure

```
MATCH (entity:Type)
WHERE filter_condition
ASSERT compliance_condition
ON_PASS action
ON_FAIL action
```

**Components**:
- **MATCH**: Which entities to check
- **WHERE**: Filter entities (optional)
- **ASSERT**: The compliance rule to verify
- **ON_PASS**: Actions when rule passes
- **ON_FAIL**: Actions when rule fails

### Supported Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `=` | Equality | `obj.status = 'active'` |
| `!=` | Not equal | `obj.owner != 'unknown'` |
| `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` | Comparison | `obj.score >= 95` |
| `MATCHES` | Regex match | `obj.name MATCHES '^[a-z_]+$'` |
| `IN` | List membership | `obj.type IN ['table', 'view']` |
| `CONTAINS` | Substring | `obj.description CONTAINS 'PII'` |
| `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` | Boolean logic | `obj.active AND NOT obj.deprecated` |

### Built-in Functions

| Function | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HAS_TAG(key)` | Check tag exists | `HAS_TAG('data-product')` |
| `TAG(key)` | Get tag value | `TAG('domain') = 'finance'` |
| `LENGTH(str)` | String length | `LENGTH(obj.name) <= 64` |
| `UPPER(str)` | To uppercase | `UPPER(obj.name)` |
| `LOWER(str)` | To lowercase | `LOWER(obj.name) = obj.name` |

### Available Actions

| Action | Syntax | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `PASS` | `PASS` | Mark as passed (default) |
| `FAIL` | `FAIL 'message'` | Mark as failed with message |
| `ASSIGN_TAG` | `ASSIGN_TAG key: 'value'` | Add/update tag |
| `REMOVE_TAG` | `REMOVE_TAG key` | Remove tag |
| `NOTIFY` | `NOTIFY 'email@company.com'` | Send notification |

### Entity Types

You can write rules for:

**Unity Catalog Objects**:
- `catalog` - Catalogs
- `schema` - Schemas
- `table` - Tables
- `view` - Views
- `function` - Functions
- `volume` - Volumes

**Application Entities**:
- `data_product` - Data products
- `data_contract` - Data contracts
- `domain` - Domains
- `glossary_term` - Glossary terms
- `review` - Review requests

**Generic**:
- `Object` - Matches all entity types

### Example Policies

#### Policy 1: Naming Conventions

**Requirement**: All tables use lowercase_snake_case; views must start with `v_`

```
MATCH (obj:Object)
WHERE obj.type IN ['table', 'view']
ASSERT
  CASE obj.type
    WHEN 'view' THEN obj.name MATCHES '^v_[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$'
    WHEN 'table' THEN obj.name MATCHES '^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$'
  END
ON_FAIL FAIL 'Names must be lowercase_snake_case. Views must start with "v_"'
ON_FAIL ASSIGN_TAG compliance_issue: 'naming_violation'
```

**Test Cases**:
- ✅ `customer_orders` (table)
- ✅ `v_active_customers` (view)
- ❌ `CustomerOrders` (table - uppercase)
- ❌ `orders_view` (view - missing `v_` prefix)

#### Policy 2: PII Data Protection

**Requirement**: All PII data must be encrypted with AES256

```
MATCH (tbl:table)
WHERE HAS_TAG('contains_pii') AND TAG('contains_pii') = 'true'
ASSERT TAG('encryption') = 'AES256'
ON_FAIL FAIL 'PII data must be encrypted with AES256'
ON_FAIL ASSIGN_TAG security_risk: 'high'
ON_FAIL NOTIFY 'security-team@company.com'
ON_PASS ASSIGN_TAG last_compliance_check: '2025-01-15'
```

**What it checks**:
- Tables tagged with `contains_pii: true`
- Must have `encryption: AES256` tag
- On failure: tags as high risk and alerts security team
- On success: updates last check timestamp

#### Policy 3: Data Product Ownership

**Requirement**: All active data products must have a valid owner

```
MATCH (prod:data_product)
WHERE prod.status IN ['active', 'certified']
ASSERT prod.owner != 'unknown' AND LENGTH(prod.owner) > 0
ON_FAIL FAIL 'Active data products must have a valid owner assigned'
ON_FAIL ASSIGN_TAG needs_attention: 'missing_owner'
ON_FAIL NOTIFY 'data-governance@company.com'
ON_PASS REMOVE_TAG needs_attention
```

#### Policy 4: Production Asset Tagging

**Requirement**: All production assets must be tagged with a data product

```
MATCH (obj:Object)
WHERE obj.type IN ['table', 'view'] AND obj.catalog = 'prod'
ASSERT HAS_TAG('data-product') OR HAS_TAG('excluded-from-products')
ON_FAIL FAIL 'All production assets must be tagged with a data product or marked as excluded'
ON_FAIL ASSIGN_TAG compliance_status: 'untagged'
ON_PASS REMOVE_TAG compliance_status
```

#### Policy 5: Schema Documentation

**Requirement**: All schemas must have meaningful descriptions

```
MATCH (sch:schema)
WHERE sch.catalog != 'temp'
ASSERT
  sch.comment != '' AND
  LENGTH(sch.comment) >= 20
ON_FAIL FAIL 'Schemas must have a description of at least 20 characters'
ON_FAIL ASSIGN_TAG documentation_status: 'incomplete'
ON_FAIL NOTIFY 'data-documentation-team@company.com'
ON_PASS ASSIGN_TAG documentation_status: 'complete'
```

### Deployment Policies

Deployment policies control which Unity Catalog catalogs and schemas users can deploy to.

#### Viewing Your Deployment Policy

Navigate to **My Profile → Deployment Policy** to see:
- Allowed catalogs (list or patterns)
- Allowed schemas (list or patterns)
- Default catalog/schema
- Whether deployments require approval
- Whether you can approve others' deployments

#### Template Variables

Deployment policies support dynamic values:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{username}` | Email prefix | `jdoe` from `jdoe@company.com` |
| `{email}` | Full email | `jdoe@company.com` |
| `{team}` | Primary team | `data-engineering` |
| `{domain}` | User's domain | `Finance` |

```json
{
  "allowed_catalogs": [
    "{username}_sandbox",
    "shared_dev",
    "staging"
  ],
  "allowed_schemas": ["*"],
  "default_catalog": "{username}_sandbox",
  "default_schema": "default"
}
```

For user `alice@company.com`, this resolves to:

### Security Best Practices

#### Token Management

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only the scopes needed
2. **Use Expiration**: Set expiration for temporary integrations
3. **Regular Rotation**: Rotate tokens periodically (e.g., every 90 days)
4. **Audit Usage**: Monitor `last_used_at` for unusual patterns
5. **Revoke Immediately**: Revoke tokens when no longer needed or compromised

#### Scope Recommendations

| Integration Type | Recommended Scopes |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Discovery Chatbot | `*:read`, `search:read` |
| Documentation Generator | `contracts:read`, `data-products:read`, `semantic:read` |
| Compliance Monitor | `contracts:read`, `data-products:read`, `analytics:read` |
| Full Automation | Specific write scopes as needed |

#### Network Security

- Use HTTPS in production
- Consider IP allowlisting for sensitive integrations
- Monitor for unusual request patterns

### Error Handling

The MCP endpoint returns standard JSON-RPC 2.0 errors:

| Error Code | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `-32600` | Invalid request format |
| `-32601` | Method not found |
| `-32602` | Invalid params |
| `-32603` | Internal error |
| `-32000` | Tool execution error |
| `-32001` | Unauthorized (invalid/missing token) |
| `-32003` | Forbidden (insufficient scopes) |

**Example Error Response**:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": {
    "code": -32003,
    "message": "Insufficient scope: requires 'data-products:write', token has ['data-products:read']"
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

### Health Check

```bash
curl https://your-ontos-instance/api/mcp/health
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## Best Practices

### Organizational Setup

#### Start with Pilot Domain

1. Choose one well-defined domain
2. Create 1-2 teams
3. Build 2-3 data contracts
4. Publish 1-2 data products
5. Learn and iterate
6. Expand to other domains

#### Establish Governance Early

- Define naming conventions
- Create compliance policies
- Set up review workflows
- Document standards

#### Leverage Demo Mode

Enable `APP_DEMO_MODE` during initial setup to see examples:
- Sample domains, teams, projects
- Example contracts and products
- Pre-configured compliance policies
- Semantic model examples

Disable once you understand the system.

### Workflow Recommendations

#### Contracts First Approach (Recommended)

1. Define the data contract
2. Get contract approved
3. Build the product implementing the contract
4. Request product certification
5. Deploy to production

**Benefits**:
- Consumer needs are clear upfront
- Reduces rework
- Enables parallel development
- Formal quality commitments

#### Products First Approach (Exploration)

1. Build the data product
2. Derive contract from implementation
3. Get contract approved retroactively
4. Request product certification

**When to Use**: Experimentation, prototypes, unclear requirements

### Naming Conventions

#### General Rules

- **Lowercase**: Use lowercase for consistency
- **Snake Case**: Use underscores between words (`customer_orders`)
- **Descriptive**: Make names self-explanatory
- **Avoid Abbreviations**: Unless they're industry-standard

#### Specific Conventions

**Domains**:
- PascalCase: `Finance`, `CustomerSuccess`
- Clear boundaries: `Retail Operations` not `RetailOps`

**Teams**:
- Lowercase with hyphens: `data-engineering`, `analytics-team`
- Include function: `finance-data-team`

**Projects**:
- Lowercase with hyphens: `customer-360-platform`
- Descriptive: `fraud-detection-ml-pipeline`

**Contracts**:
- Lowercase with hyphens: `customer-data-contract`
- Include domain: `finance-transactions-contract`

**Products**:
- Lowercase with hyphens: `customer-360-view`
- Include type: `pos-transaction-stream` (source)

**Tags**:
- Lowercase, no spaces: `pii`, `realtime`, `certified`
- Namespace with prefix: `domain:finance`, `type:aggregate`

### Semantic Linking Strategy

#### When to Link

**Always Link**:
- Important domain concepts
- PII and sensitive fields
- Customer and user identifiers
- Financial fields
- Core business entities

**Consider Linking**:
- Technical metadata fields
- Calculated fields with business meaning
- Aggregated metrics

**Don't Link**:
- Pure technical fields (e.g., `_created_at`, `_id`)
- Temporary columns in transformations
- System-generated fields with no business meaning

#### Three-Tier Linking

Apply semantic links at all three levels for maximum value:

1. **Contract → Business Domain**
2. **Schema → Business Entity**
3. **Property → Business Attribute**

This enables complete semantic traceability.

### Compliance Policy Strategy

#### Policy Categories

Organize policies by category:

- **Governance**: Naming, documentation, ownership
- **Security**: Encryption, access control, PII protection
- **Quality**: Completeness, accuracy, freshness
- **Operations**: Monitoring, SLOs, availability

#### Policy Severity

Assign appropriate severity:

- **Critical**: Security violations, data loss risks
- **High**: Governance requirements, quality issues
- **Medium**: Best practice violations
- **Low**: Recommendations, nice-to-haves

#### Progressive Enforcement

1. **Phase 1**: Create policies, run manually, generate reports
2. **Phase 2**: Enable automated runs, send notifications
3. **Phase 3**: Block deployments based on policy failures
4. **Phase 4**: Auto-remediation where possible

### Review Workflow Optimization

#### Request Grouping

Group related assets in single review requests:

**Good**:
- All tables for a data product
- Tables and views for a feature
- Assets being promoted together

**Avoid**:
- Mixing unrelated assets
- Too many assets (>10) in one request
- Assets not ready for review

#### Steward Assignment

Assign the right steward:

- **Domain Steward**: For domain-specific reviews
- **Security Officer**: For PII/security reviews
- **Technical Steward**: For complex technical assets
- **General Steward**: For routine reviews

#### Response Times

Set expectations:

- **Standard Reviews**: 2-3 business days
- **Urgent Reviews**: 1 business day (pre-arranged)
- **Complex Reviews**: Up to 1 week

Communicate timelines clearly.

### Data Product Lifecycle Management

#### Version Tagging

Tag products with version indicators:

- `v1`, `v2`, `v3` - Major versions
- `stable`, `beta`, `alpha` - Maturity
- `deprecated` - Products being sunset

#### Deprecation Process

When deprecating a product:

1. Announce 90 days in advance (minimum)
2. Mark product as "Deprecated" with sunset date
3. Communicate replacement product
4. Send reminders at 60, 30, and 7 days
5. Track consumer usage
6. Archive after sunset date
7. Keep documentation available

#### Consumer Communication

Notify consumers of changes:

- **Breaking Changes**: 90-day notice, major version bump
- **New Features**: Release notes, minor version bump
- **Bug Fixes**: Release notes, patch version bump
- **Deprecations**: Multiple reminders over 90 days

Use Ontos notifications and external channels (email, Slack).
